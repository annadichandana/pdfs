      "refined_text": "15 The existing systems suffer from several key limitations such as •No real-time room availability tracking. •Lack of user-friendly interfaces for students and admins. •Manual allotment leads to errors and delays. •No room preview or layout visualization for students. •Absence of role-based login access and secure authentication. •No integration of modern features like email notifications or AR. 2.2 OUR VALUE PROPOSITION: Our Hostel Room Allotment System solves the common problems seen in manual and outdated hostel allocation methods. Instead of relying on spreadsheets or paper-based processes, our system offers a smart and automated solution. It allows students to check room availability in real-time, submit their preferences, and even explore rooms virtually using 3D or AR-based visualization. The admin can easily manage student data, room status, and allotments through a clean and easy-to-use dashboard. The system also sends email updates and supports password resets, making it smooth and user-friendly for both students and administrators. Overall, it brings more transparency, reduces workload, and improves the entire hostel allocation experience.",

      "refined_text": "11 ABSTRACT Generally, administrators who allot rooms to students rely on static lists or manual selection without a clear idea of the room’s availability and amenities. With AR- based 3D modelling, they can virtually explore available rooms before allotting rooms. The system will display real time room availability, occupancy details, furniture, amenities, and other essential information when they search for rooms. This eliminates uncertainty and enhances the overall hostel allocation experience and it also reduces clashes. The Hostel Allocation System is a web-based application that helps allocate hostel rooms to students efficiently based on availability, preferences, and predefined rules. It aims to reduce manual effort and provide a smooth allocation process for both students and administrators. Our Hostel Room Allotment System uses Django (Python) for backend, MySQL for database, and Django Auth System for authentication. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. WebXR and Three.js enable AR-based 3D visualization, allowing students to explore their assigned rooms virtually.",
